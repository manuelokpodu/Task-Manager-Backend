// In backend development, a model is like a blue-print for the data in your application. it defines the structure of your data and how it interacts with the database.

const mongoose = require("mongoose"); // Import Mongoose

const schema = mongoose.Schema; // Shortcut to access Mongoose Schema class

// Define the schema for task based on the UI
const taskSchema = new schema({
  title: String, // Title of the task
  description: String, // Description of the task
  tag: String, // tag associated with the task "urgent or important"
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("task", taskSchema); // Export the model to be used for Request operations in the controller
